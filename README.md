# What is Juscelino?

Juscelino is a very simple balancing robot plataform designed for my final year project, required to finish my electrical technician course.

As almost all the resource used in this project was found in the web, I decided to share everything that I've designed myself or found in my research, so others who are also interested in robotics and engineering can try designing their own Balancing Robot Plataform with ease.

With time I'll make a step-by-step guide with all the information needed (or at least that I've acquired) to make this project work, but I strongly suggest you use it only as a reference. A few files were lost after all the time that went by after finishing my degree, so I'll be rebuilding the project as I have time.
